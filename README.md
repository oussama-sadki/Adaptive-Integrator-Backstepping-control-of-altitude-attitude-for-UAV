# Nonlinear-Control-of-Attitude-and-Position-of-a-Quadrotor
This project is about modeling and control of a Quadrotor. UAVs are known to be underactuated systems which means that inputs are lesser than controlled variables.
In other words, it is impossible to control all position(x,y,z) and orientation(roll,pitch,yaw) which amount to 6 DOF simultaneously as only four actuators. That's why only 4 DOF are controlled according to the user preferences.
here we present the control of x,y,z, and yaw using integrator backstepping technique.
